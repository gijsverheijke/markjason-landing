## What is markjason?

A stupidly fast macOS app for `.md`, `.json`, and `.env` files.

If you work with AI and accumulate lots of markdown specs, JSON configs, and .env files, you know the pain: opening a heavyweight IDE just to read a file, waiting for Electron apps to boot, or fighting with cluttered file browsers.

markjason is the antidote:

- ⚡ **Fast** — Native Swift, no Electron.
- 🎯 **Focused** — Just markdown, JSON, and .env. Nothing else.
- 🌙 **Dark mode only** — As nature intended.
- 💾 **Auto-save** — With clear feedback. Never lose work.
- 📁 **Lots of carefully crafted details** For the vibes.

## Design and UX

markjason's dark interface is meant to be easy on the eyes, and optimized for focus.

The logo `#{}` is a mashup of:
- `#` — Markdown heading syntax
- `{}` — JSON object syntax

Indicators in markjason are inspired by the Apollo Command Module. A warm, vintage light. I love them and I hope you will too.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
