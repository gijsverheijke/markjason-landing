# markjason landing page

Landing page for **markjason** — a stupidly fast macOS app for `.md` and `.json` files.

## The App

markjason is for people who work with AI and accumulate lots of markdown and JSON files. It's:

- ⚡ **Instant** — opens in ~0.3 seconds
- 🌙 **Dark mode only** — as nature intended  
- 🎯 **Focused** — just markdown and JSON, nothing else
- 💾 **Auto-save** — with clear feedback and undo/redo
- 📁 **Drag & drop** — because it's not 1995

## This Repo

Just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. No build tools. No dependencies. No drama.

```
index.html  # The page
style.css   # Dark mode magic
script.js   # Minimal interactions
```

## Deploy

Works out of the box with:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify (just drag the folder)
- Any static file server

## Local Dev

```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Node
npx serve

# Or just open index.html in a browser
```

## Logo

The logo is `#{}`  — a mashup of:
- `#` — markdown heading syntax
- `{}` — JSON object syntax

Simple. Memorable. Typeable.

Made for people who read too many AI outputs.
